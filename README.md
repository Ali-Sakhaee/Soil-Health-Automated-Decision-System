# AI4SoilHealth automated decision system

## 1. Introduction

The AI4SoilHealth automated decision system is an interactive assessment tool designed to help users explore soil health conditions across Europe and provide automated decision-support.  
The application allows users to define an Area of Interest (AOI) on an interactive map and receive a summary of key soil health threats based on land-use characteristics for that location, along with practical advice on how to mitigate identified soil health threats.

## 2. Purpose of the Application

The decision system is intended to:

- Provide **location-specific soil health assessments**  
- Support **interpretation of soil condition** using harmonized European datasets  
- Help users identify **potential soil degradation risks**  
- Offer **context-specific management guidance**

## 3. What the Decision System shows

After an AOI is defined on the map, the decision system displays:

### **3.1 Country**
Identifies the country in which the selected area is located.

### **3.2 Dominant Land Use**
Shows whether the AOI is primarily:
- Cropland  
- Grassland  
- Forestry  

This helps contextualize the soil threats within the land-use setting.

### **3.3 Detected Soil Threats**
The decision system highlights key soil threats relevant to European soil health monitoring, including:

- Soil organic carbon (SOC) loss  
- Subsoil compaction  
- Salinization  
- Excess nutrient accumulation  
- Acidification  

In the current version, each indicator is derived from the AOI-averaged soil properties and rescaled to a common 0–1 scale:

- **0** = no threat / outside risk range  
- **1** = severe threat  

Indicators above **0.2** are considered notable and are highlighted under *Detected soil threats*.

These thresholds and transformations are based on rule-based mappings defined in the application logic. They ensure consistency across regions and land-use types.

### **3.4 Management Considerations**
When available, direct links to relevant management guidance are provided based on:

- The country  
- The dominant land use  
- The specific threat detected  

If no curated guidance exists, the decision system automatically generates a search query to help the user to get a first overview on the specific soil threat and region-specific guidance on how to remediate the soil threat.

### **3.5 Visual Threat Overview**
A polar diagram presents the relative magnitude of the five soil threats.  
This visualization enables quick comparison and supports communication of soil condition patterns.

## 4. How Users Interact with the Application

1. **Open the application**  
   The map loads with navigation controls and drawing tools.

2. **Define an Area of Interest**  
   Users can draw a polygon over any region of Europe.

3. **View the assessment**  
   The right panel updates automatically to show:
   - Country  
   - Dominant land use  
   - Detected soil threats  
   - Management guidance (if available)  
   - A visual summary of threat intensity  

4. **Interpret the results**  
   The user can explore how soil condition varies across locations.

## 5. Data Sources (High Level)

The dashboard integrates harmonized, pan-European soil datasets generated by the [AI4SoilHealth]( https://ai4soilhealth.eu/)  project , as well as land-use information derived from the [CORINE Land Cover dataset](https://doi.org/10.2909/960998c1-1870-4e82-8051-6485205ebbac).  
These datasets have been standardized and preprocessed prior to use in the application.
